# DataEng
Final project for i320d- Data Engineering 

In this project, we have been tasked to create a data pipeline that shares insights about the animals that have been taken into the Austin Animal Center (AAC) over the years. As a group, we are all responsible for contributing to and understanding each part of the project. This project is supposed to mirror the example data pipeline that was demonstrated to us during the first 10 weeks of the semester. We are responsible for understanding the data we have been given, load the data into Superset, creating the dimensional model, creating and running the dbt model files, designing our data products, and creating the visualizations.
